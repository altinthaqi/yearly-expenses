<h1 align="center">Yearly Expenses</h1>

<p align="center">Yearly Expenses is a mini-Application built with ReactJS, where I used plenty of features that React has to offer.</p>
<p align="center">Yearly Expenses is an expenses tracker of the things you bought over the years. You can add new items and than find/filter the items you bought through the years. You can also track what month you spent the most amount of money, with the implemented Graph feature that spreads over 12 months of the year, where each month holds the percentage of money spent during that year.<p>
